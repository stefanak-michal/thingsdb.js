# ThingsDB.js

## Description

This project provides a JavaScript connector library that enables seamless interaction with [ThingsDB](https://www.thingsdb.io/), a powerful time-series database, from both backend and frontend environments. It simplifies data access, manipulation, and querying for developers using JavaScript.

## Status

This project is developed but it requires some polishing. It works for Node.js projects as in browser. Feel free to contribute or raise issues to help us shape this connector into a robust and valuable tool.
